#**Dynamic Policy Manager** 

##**Overview**
The Dynamic Policies Manager component is responsible for the management of the policies related
to technical and business performance associated with each application and the detection and prediction
of violations of such policies in the running application.
In the 1st release of the Dynamic Policy Manager starts to define and send the policy configured to the Monitoring and
Logging component. The DPM creates and sends the policy information to the Monitoring and
Telemetry component. The monitoring component sends an alert and the values of the violation -if
needed- to the Policy Evaluator. The Policy Evaluator sends the alert violation to the Policy Violation
Manager.The Policy Violation Manager stores and analyses the violation and if the remediation action is provided
by itself; it then sends the remediation action to the Job Manager otherwise the Policy Violation Manager
sends a request of the suggested action to the intelligence block.
